The purpose of the `getSearchStateDist` method is to retrieve information about state districts from a PostgreSQL database and provide it through an API endpoint. This method supports pagination based on `pageNumber` and `pageSize` parameters, allowing users to fetch a specific subset of state district data from the database. The retrieved data includes details such as district names and other associated information.
